Working through [Chapter 2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) of *The Rust Programming Lanaguage* book (as well as learning how to use GitHub effectivel, and eventually to use VS Code with the whole shebang). I'll update this file as I update the code through the examples.

* **2025-06-27 15:23** Initial, Listing 2-1.
* **15:28** Adding a mini example of my own.
* **15:38** Moving on to the next listing, 2-3 (adding a random number)
